"""Pluggable photo-age predictor.

Real status: NO trained weights ship with this service, and none exist
publicly for a droppable model — see README.md for why (no license on the
reference repo, no shipped weights, dog-only coverage, author's own accuracy
caveat). Until AGE_MODEL_WEIGHTS points at a real trained model, predict()
honestly returns confidence=0 / status="untrained" rather than a fabricated
number. TensorFlow is only imported if a weights file is actually configured,
so this service runs today without requiring a multi-hundred-MB ML runtime
just to serve the honest "no model yet" response.
