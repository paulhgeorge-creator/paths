# Frailty Onboarding - Pawl Physiological Age Questionnaire

A 4-part, owner-input frailty questionnaire that estimates a pet's *physiological age* (how old their body is behaving) versus chronological age. No hardware, no vet visit required to start. Single self-contained HTML file - open `index.html` in a browser, no build step. A separate optional Flask service (`age-service/`) backs photo-based age estimation - see below; the questionnaire works fully without it.

Deficit-accumulation model adapted from Banzato et al. 2019 (33-item canine Frailty Index) and the Loyal Canine Frailty Index. Wellness instrument, not a diagnostic one - no lifespan or prognosis claims.

## How it works

Two numbers drive everything:

1. **Chronological age** - a single fused value, never a life-stage category. See "Onboarding flow & age fusion" below.
2. **Observed FI** (Frailty Index) - Σ(scores of answered deficits) ÷ (items answered). Each deficit is scored 0 (absent), 0.5 (mild), or 1 (severe/present).

Observed FI is compared against the **expected FI for that age** - a continuous curve anchored at young ≈ 0.08, middle-aged ≈ 0.11, senior ≈ 0.23 (Banzato et al. 2019's actual reported mean FI by age band - young 2-6y, middle 7-10y, old 10+y - not placeholder guesses), interpolated by age-as-a-fraction-of-life-stage (no discontinuity at bracket edges). Banzato also reports an approximately linear FI-vs-age relationship across their sample, which is why piecewise-linear interpolation between anchors is a literature-consistent shape rather than an invented curve.

A brachycephalic-breed modifier raises the expected-FI baseline for breeds with breed-typical breathing/skin-fold traits (bulldogs, pugs, etc.), and a separate chondrodystrophic-breed modifier does the same for breeds with FGF4-driven early spinal-disc degeneration (dachshunds, corgis, basset hounds), so those findings don't inflate the score the way a new deficit would elsewhere. Breeds in both lists (Shih Tzu, Pekingese) take the larger of the two modifiers, not the sum. Size-adjusted aging (giant breeds age on a compressed timeline) falls out of the same size-based senior-onset cutoffs already used for life-stage bucketing - now set to real benchmarks (small 11 / medium 9 / large 7.5 / giant 5.5 yr, midpoints of small 10-12 / medium 8-10 / large 7-8 / giant 5-6). The direction of that size ordering is also backed by the fact that larger dogs lose roughly one month of lifespan per 2kg of body mass - cited as qualitative support only, since that's a lifespan-shortening rate, not a senior-onset-age rate, and turning it into a formula would be false precision. The same size-based lookup (`seniorGuessAge`) now also drives the "looks senior, DOB unknown" age guess, replacing an earlier flat 8-year guess that ignored size/species entirely.

Cats get no independently-calibrated FI-age curve - no quantitative feline FI-by-age literature exists yet (current feline frailty research is phenotype/qualitative, not a numeric index). Rather than assume the dog-derived anchors transfer 1:1, cat deltas are dampened toward "typical" (`CAT_DELTA_DAMPENING`) as an honest lower-confidence stand-in for real feline calibration data.

```
physiological_age = chronological_age + β × (observed_FI − expected_FI_for_age)
```

clamped so no estimate can swing more than a defined max years below/above chronological age, and floored at a small positive number. This additive form replaced an earlier multiplicative formula that could send a healthy senior's estimate collapsing toward a very young age. `β`, the clamp, both breed modifiers, and the cat dampening factor all live as named placeholder constants in `frailty-model.js`'s `FRAILTY_MODEL_CONFIG` - flagged with a `ponytail:` comment as interim, pending real calibration data (see Sources note below); the FI anchors and senior-onset ages are the parts of this pass with an actual literature source behind the numbers.

The headline result is a **single figure, no range shown** (a later product-direction change from an earlier range-plus-headline display - the underlying `low`/`high` band is still computed internally and narrows as more items get answered, just not displayed). The four parts exist to feed progressively more deficits into that same formula, recomputing the estimate each time. Skipped items simply don't count toward the denominator - no penalty for stopping early. The aging-pace comparison ("aging slower/typical/faster") is expressed as a **percentage of chronological age** (`deltaPercentOfAge` - e.g. "aging about 15% faster than typical"), shown as a caption on the Health Score card (see "Result page" below), not as a separate competing metric.

FI zones (wellness-framed, never clinical): **Thriving** (FI < 0.12) · **Steady** (0.12–0.24) · **Needs attention** (0.25–0.4) · **Talk to your vet** (> 0.4, always routes to a vet prompt, never a prognosis).

Species: dog and cat share one shell. Species-specific items (e.g. stairs vs. jumping to a perch) are swapped automatically. Cat outputs carry a wider uncertainty band (feline aging science lags dogs) and use the Cambridge 2017 formula (`human_years ≈ 4.14 × cat_age + 15`) for a human-year equivalent; dogs now get the same treatment via the Wang et al. 2020 formula (`human_years ≈ 16 × ln(dog_age) + 31`) - previously only cats had a human-year figure.

## Onboarding flow & age fusion

Baseline is now a provided embeddable widget ("Pet Vitals Survey", `PV_WIDGET_HTML`/`initPetVitalsWidget()` in `index.html`), kept intact byte-for-byte (2 approved text-only fixes: em dash and curly quotes, to match the project's house style) - its own scoped `.pv-root` CSS, its own SVG illustrations, its own toy "vitality score" ring all work exactly as given. `wirePetVitalsToState()` is a fully separate, additive layer of listeners on the same elements that feeds the *real* app state (species/name/breed/weight/age) alongside the widget's own untouched handlers - it never reads from or modifies the widget's internal variables.

**Capability trade-offs from this swap** (the widget doesn't have equivalent inputs, so these no longer have a UI path from baseline - flagging per your own "tell me and we'll find a workaround" instruction, not silently dropped):
- **Photo-based age estimation** - `age-estimator.js`/`age-service/` still exist and still work (tested, running), just currently unreachable from any UI. No photo upload field in the widget.
- **Exact date of birth** - the widget's single "Age (yrs)" field is wired as the same low-confidence years-only signal the old "I don't know the exact date" path used (`b.dobKnown = false; b.yearsOnlyAge = ...`), not a real DOB. Age confidence for every pet is now capped at 0.5 instead of ever reaching 1.0 from baseline.
- **Weight units** - kg only; the widget has no kg/lb toggle.
- **Sex/neuter status** - no field for it in the widget; was informational-only before (not part of the FI denominator), so this is a data-capture loss, not a scoring one.
- **New, not yet wired into scoring**: daily activity level (low/moderate/high) prefills Part 1's activity-minutes question so it isn't asked twice; sleep hours and health goals are captured (`state.baseline.sleepHours`, `state.baseline.healthGoals`) but not yet used by any scoring or personalization logic - no existing FI item covers sleep *duration* (Part 2's `p2_sleep` is about sleep *changes*, a different axis) or goal-based content selection.

Everything below this point (age fusion, photo estimation, BCS, activity thresholds, percentile ranking) is unchanged - only how baseline collects the raw inputs changed, not how they flow through the model.

**`computeFinalAge()`** (in `index.html`) fuses whatever signals are available via `fuseAge()` (in `frailty-model.js`), a confidence-weighted average - never a single model or category deciding alone:

| Signal | Confidence |
|---|---|
| Exact DOB | 1.0 |
| Owner's years-only guess (DOB unknown) | 0.5 |
| Photo-based estimate | the model's own reported confidence (`0` today - see below) |
| Size-based population prior | 0.1 (last-resort floor so fusion is never empty) |

A signal with confidence 0 contributes nothing to the weighted average - this is how "don't rely on image-based estimation alone" is enforced in code, not just in copy.

### Photo-based age estimation

`age-estimator.js` exposes the one pluggable seam, `estimateAgeFromPhoto(file, {species})`, which POSTs to a local Flask service (`age-service/`, default `http://localhost:5001`) and resolves to `{years, confidence, status}` - network errors, timeouts, or the service not running all resolve to `confidence: 0`, never throw, and never block the rest of onboarding.

**The service has no trained model behind it yet, on purpose, not by oversight.** `szmazurek/Age_recognition_Cyfrovet` (the referenced repo) was inspected: it's a TensorFlow *training pipeline*, not a packaged model - no shipped weights, no LICENSE file (real legal risk to copy its code into this project without contacting the author), a 3-bucket age classification (not continuous years), dog-only (no cats), and the author's own README says results are "still not satisfying." A labeled image dataset matching that repo's Young/Adult/Senior folder structure was located separately (Google Drive, ~2022) but its licensing/provenance is unconfirmed (looks Petfinder-scraped) - still a blocker, not yet a green light to train on it. `age-service/README.md` has the full breakdown and the real path to wiring in a trained model later. Until then the service honestly returns `confidence: 0` / `status: "untrained"`, which `fuseAge()` treats as no signal. If a photo is provided, the body-condition chart step is skipped entirely (assumption: a photo could visually substitute for a self-reported BCS; body condition then defaults to "ideal" (5) and doesn't count toward the FI, same as any other skipped item).

### Body condition chart

`BCS_CHART` in `frailty-model.js` is a real 9-point WSAVA/Purina-style body-condition scale (both dog and cat, ideal band at 4–5) with a short description per point. Its own onboarding step (between baseline and Part 1, skipped if a photo was provided) shows the description live as the owner drags a 1–9 slider, alongside a real reference chart image per species (`assets/bcs-chart-dog.png` - Daily Paws/WSAVA; `assets/bcs-chart-cat.webp` - APOP/Bjornvad & Laflamme) with a "View full-size chart" button/click-to-open. The per-BCS-point `imageHook` keys (e.g. `bcs-dog-5`) still exist on each `BCS_CHART` entry as a hook for per-point photos later, but the step currently shows one whole-chart reference image per species rather than nine individual crops.

### Weight-based percentile ranking

`overweightPercentile(species, bcs)` returns a "Top N%" figure anchored on real cited prevalence stats: BCS 8 → 22% (dogs) / 33% (cats) obese; BCS 6 → 59% (dogs) / 61% (cats) overweight-or-obese. BCS 7 and 9 are linearly interpolated/extrapolated between those anchors - flagged in code, not independently sourced. BCS ≤ 5 (ideal or underweight) returns `null`. Surfaced as personalized copy in the result page's "What helps" card (see below) rather than a standalone pill, to avoid a second competing metric next to Health Score.

### Extensible activity-minutes thresholds

`getActivityMinutesThreshold(species, weightKg, breed)` checks a breed-override table (`ACTIVITY_BREED_OVERRIDES`, sourced from general breed-energy-level characterizations) before falling back to the existing size-class default. Adding a real per-breed number later is a one-line addition to that object - no logic changes needed. Still flagged as illustrative (see Status below) - no public source gives real size/breed-stratified activity minutes.

## Design system

Every page (BCS, Part 1-4, results, completion) uses the same `.pv-` design language as the baseline widget (Cormorant/Inter fonts, cream/blue/ash palette, pill buttons and segmented controls, SVG ring progress indicator) via a shared `pvShell(wordmark, step, bodyHtml, footerHtml)` helper in `index.html` - each page supplies its own content, the shell supplies the consistent header/ring/footer chrome. `PV_STEP_ORDER` + `pvStepPct()` drive the ring's percentage across the whole flow (baseline has its own separate 6-field-completion ring, since that widget block is verbatim/unmodified - see below). The global CSS duplicates the widget's own scoped rules (harmless, idempotent) rather than editing `PV_WIDGET_HTML`, so that block stays byte-identical.

## Result page

The Part 1–4 result screens show, in order: a stage headline ("{name} is in the {stage} stage"), two large primary stats (**Pet Age** - the physiological estimate, `r.center` - and **Human Age**, the Wang 2020 / Cambridge 2017 equivalent, captioned as "what a human would be at the same biological stage" so it can't be mistaken for the pet's real age), a WHOOP-style circular **Health Score** (0–100, `healthScore()` in `frailty-model.js`, reusing `fiZone`'s own FI breakpoints rather than inventing a second scale, with the aging-pace percentage as its caption), then two cards - **Watch out for** and **What helps** - each exactly 3 items, built from `STAGE_CONTENT` (species × stage authored care guidance) with 1–2 dynamic entries swapped in from this pet's actual answers (`personalizedInsights()` - a vet-flag or overweight-percentile hit bumps a real, specific line to the top rather than staying purely generic).

Life-stage display uses a **4th "Puppy"/"Kitten" bucket** (`lifeStageDisplay()`, <1yr) layered on top of the existing 3-bucket `lifeStage()` - purely a display label; it does not touch the expected-FI curve math, which still runs on the original 3-bucket function. Ages under 1 year display in months ("2 mo"), not "0 yrs" - whole-year rounding reads as broken for very young pets. Age uncertainty is reflected in tone ("Estimated - sharpens as you answer more"), never a raw confidence percentage, per the product rule that the copy shouldn't expose internal scoring mechanics.

## Completion page

Reached either by finishing round 4 or by clicking "I'm happy with this estimate" on any earlier round (that button was previously a no-op - clicking it did nothing; it now correctly ends the flow). Calls `computeResult(4)` unconditionally, which is safe regardless of how far the owner actually got - unanswered questions from skipped rounds simply don't count, same rule as everywhere else.

**Health Multiplier** (`healthMultiplier()` in `frailty-model.js`) is `observedFI / expectedFI-for-age`, clamped to [0.4, 2] for display sanity - 1.0x is the neutral "exactly typical for age" baseline, not a score to maximize. This is a deliberately different metric from page 2's Health Score (0-100) and aging-pace percentage - same underlying FI/eFI numbers, expressed as a ratio instead, for a different moment in the flow. It does not reverse the earlier "percentage over multiplier" product decision for the page-2 delta badge, which is unchanged.

**Body condition** reuses `BCS_CHART` and `overweightPercentile()` already built for onboarding, with the percentile reframed as a comparison rather than a ranking (`percentileSoftCopy()` - "fuller-bodied than roughly N% of {species}s their size" instead of "Top N% most overweight") so it doesn't read as judgmental.

**Wearable connection** is an honest placeholder, not fake functionality - clicking "Connect a wearable" shows a plain "isn't live yet" message rather than pretending a connection succeeded. No wearable API exists to integrate; building a real one needs a native companion app or a specific device SDK, out of scope for a static HTML file.

**Manual activity/food input** (`state.followup`) seeds exercise minutes from the onboarding activity answer instead of asking twice, and adds meals-per-day, food-type (kibble/wet/raw/homemade/mixed, descriptive only), portion-size, and treats-frequency fields. **Food & Activity Balance** (`foodActivityBalance()`) averages whichever of those are actually filled in (0 = ideal, 1 = concerning, the same convention used everywhere else in this model) into a 0-100 percentage with soft, non-alarming copy at every tier - never a hard "you're over the limit" framing.

**Food equation** re-expresses that same balance score two more ways: `foodEquationMultiplier()` maps it onto a 0.75x-1.75x range (1.0x = middle, no hard cutoff either end - a distinct number from the page's Health Multiplier, same non-alarming intent), and `foodBalancePercentile()` reframes it as "better-balanced than about N% of {species}s" for a comparable feel. Both are explicitly derived from the same single balance number, not an independently sourced population distribution - there's no real dataset for this synthetic combined score to compare against.

## Validation notes

- The `fiZone` Steady/Needs-attention boundary (FI 0.24) lines up closely with a cited FI > 0.25 "elevated mortality risk" threshold - the boundary is validated by that number, not derived from it.
- Frailty-phenotype survival-time data (frail dogs ≈ 10.5mo, pre-frail ≈ 35.4mo, non-frail ≈ 42.5mo median survival) supports why the "Talk to your vet" zone exists at all, but those survival numbers are never surfaced in UI copy - the original spec's guardrail against lifespan/prognosis claims stands.
- `bcsToDeficit`'s thresholds are validated after the fact by the Purina lifetime calorie-restriction study: the control group's BCS (6.7, a 2.2-point deviation from ideal) already scores as "severe" under the existing thresholds, and the calorie-restricted group's BCS (4.6, 0.1 off ideal) scores as "ideal" - no threshold change needed.

## The four sections

### Part 1 - Core (8 items) → initial estimate
Mobility, activity/energy, exhaustion, stiffness/gait, appetite change, coat/grooming, overall vitality (owner gestalt), and body condition score. Activity is asked as a countable daily-minutes figure (system judges adequacy against species/breed/size thresholds, not the owner's own sense of "normal") and stiffness is asked as an objective yes/no-ish observation ("needs a moment to get up after resting") - both replace earlier "...than usual" comparative wording that let owners under- or over-report based on their own baseline assumptions. Other comparative items (exhaustion, coat, later social withdrawal, temperature sensitivity) were left as-is - no good countable substitute exists without disproportionate added friction.

**Reveals:** a same-day, cross-system snapshot - deliberately not just "easy" mobility questions, so the early number isn't skewed toward one body system.
**Adds value:** a 90-second payoff - a shareable estimate card that hooks the return-visit loop. Band: ± ~3 years.

### Part 2 - Senses, mind & surface (8 items) → first refinement
Vision, hearing, disorientation/cognition, sleep changes, social withdrawal or clinginess, oral/dental signs, skin lumps, weight trend.

**Reveals:** age-linked deficits that are slower to notice - things owners see day-to-day but don't usually connect to aging (especially early cognitive decline).
**Adds value:** tightens the band to ± ~2 years.

### Part 3 - Internal & systemic signals (9 items) → second refinement
Water intake, urination, continence, digestion, breathing, exercise tolerance, muscle condition, temperature sensitivity, pain signals.

**Reveals:** organ-system aging (kidney, heart, GI, musculoskeletal) - signs owners observe but rarely link to a single underlying cause.
**Adds value:** band tightens to ± ~1.2 years; highest medical relevance, most likely section to surface a "needs attention" flag.

### Part 4 - History & clinical context (8 items) → final refinement
Chronic diagnoses, current medications, recent vet visits, dental history, surgical/injury history, and optional vet-supplied bloodwork/organ findings, plus a free-text owner concern. All clinical items are opt-in - never required, never inferred.

**Reveals:** cumulative deficit burden that owner-observation alone misses - things already caught by a vet.
**Adds value:** final band ± ~0.8 years on the full 33-item FI - most accurate number, but slowest, which is why it's gated behind three rounds of buy-in.

## Status / known simplifications

- `EXPECTED_FI_ANCHORS` (young/middle/senior) and `DOG_SENIOR_ONSET` (size-based senior ages) are now literature-backed (Banzato et al. 2019; real senior-onset benchmarks) - no longer placeholders.
- `BETA`, `MAX_DELTA_YEARS`, `BRACHY_BREED_FI_MODIFIER`, `CHONDRO_BREED_FI_MODIFIER`, `CAT_DELTA_DAMPENING`, and `ACTIVITY_MINUTES_TABLE` remain illustrative placeholders - checked against public literature for this pass and confirmed that no source gives a numeric FI-delta-to-years coefficient, breed-modifier magnitude, size-stratified activity-minutes standard, or feline FI-age curve. Flagged inline with `ponytail:` comments; the model is isolated in one function/config block so these can be swapped in cleanly once real calibration data exists.
- **Citation note:** this README (and the original code comments) cited "Teng et al. 2024" for the calibration source; a later product-review pass referenced "McMillan et al. 2024" for the same claim. Neither could be verified as a real canine/feline frailty-index paper via public search in this pass - still unresolved, calibrating off Banzato et al. 2019 in the meantime rather than guessing.
- Reproductive status detail (intact + age, a life-table modifier per the spec) isn't broken out as its own field yet; sex/neuter status is captured at baseline.
- Cat model is explicitly dog-derived-plus-confidence-dampened (`CAT_DELTA_DAMPENING`), not independently calibrated - no quantitative feline FI-by-age data exists publicly yet. Wider uncertainty bands and the Cambridge 2017 human-year formula are implemented; labeled as estimates in the UI.
- The brachycephalic- and chondrodystrophic-breed lists and activity-minutes thresholds (including the new `ACTIVITY_BREED_OVERRIDES`) are substring/lookup-matched against free-text breed input and illustrative thresholds - not a structured breed database.
- The single headline age (`r.center`, physiological estimate) is shown with no range - a later product-direction change from an earlier range-plus-headline display; the `low`/`high` band is still computed internally, just not rendered.
- `age-service/` has no trained model - a real, running Flask service with a real endpoint contract, but `confidence: 0` until real weights exist. See "Photo-based age estimation" above and `age-service/README.md` for exactly why and what's needed to change that (licensing, dataset, GPU training time - none of which happen inside a coding session). A candidate labeled dataset was located but its license/provenance is unconfirmed - flagged, not used.
- `overweightPercentile`'s BCS 7/9 values are interpolated/extrapolated, not independently sourced (BCS 6/8 are the real cited anchors).
- `healthScore()`'s 0–100 anchors reuse `fiZone`'s own FI breakpoints for consistency, but those breakpoints themselves are still the original spec's round-number wellness bands (only the 0.24 one has an independent citation - see Validation notes) - not a clinically validated 0–100 scoring instrument.
- `STAGE_CONTENT` (the per-stage "watch out for"/"what helps" copy) is general veterinary-informed care guidance authored for this pass, not a vet-reviewed clinical protocol - same wellness-not-diagnostic framing as the rest of the app.
- Per-BCS-point reference photos (`imageHook` keys on `BCS_CHART`) remain unused hook points - the BCS step currently shows one whole-chart image per species instead (see "Body condition chart" above).
- `healthMultiplier()`'s [0.4, 2] display clamp and `foodActivityBalance()`'s equal-weighting of activity/portion/treats are both reasonable-default choices, not independently validated ratios.
- Wearable connection is a real, honest UI placeholder (no fake "connected" state) - no wearable API integration exists yet; that's real remaining work, not a stub avoided for time.
- All project text and UI copy had em dashes replaced with plain hyphens project-wide this pass (comments included, not just user-facing strings); en dashes used in number ranges (e.g. "0-100") were left alone since the request named the em dash specifically.

## Testing

Pure scoring logic lives in `frailty-model.js` (no DOM dependency), tested with a zero-dependency Node script:

```
node test/frailty-model.test.js
```

Covers named fixtures: a bulldog with breed-typical findings (should not read prematurely old), a dachshund whose low activity is objectively surfaced by the minutes question and whose chondrodystrophic modifier is smaller than the bulldog's brachy modifier, a shih tzu (in both breed lists, gets the max modifier not the sum), a genuinely-declining great dane (proves the fix isn't one-directional), healthy senior dogs/cat (should not collapse toward a young estimate), cat-vs-dog delta dampening on identical inputs, size-based senior-guess ages, dog/cat human-year parity (Wang 2020 / Cambridge 2017), a young unhealthy dog (exercises the delta clamp), an unknown-DOB cat (confirms the size-based age-guess fallback lands in the correct life-stage bucket), breed-override activity thresholds, prevalence-anchored overweight percentiles, confidence-weighted age fusion (including the zero-confidence-signal-contributes-nothing case), the delta-as-percentage helper, BCS chart data shape, the puppy/kitten display bucket (confirms it doesn't affect the underlying FI-curve bucket), and the health-score anchors (confirms consistency with `fiZone`'s own breakpoints), the health multiplier (1.0 baseline, clamped range, zero-denominator guard), and food/activity balance (all-ideal/all-concerning bounds, partial-input averaging), the food equation multiplier (stays within its own 0.75x-1.75x limits), and the food balance percentile. 37 fixtures total.

`age-service/` has its own zero-dependency-beyond-Flask test suite:

```
cd age-service && python test_app.py
```

Covers the health check and the `/estimate-age` contract (missing image, invalid image, and the honest untrained-model response shape).

## Run it

No build step. Either:

```
open index.html
```

or serve locally:

```
python -m http.server 8420
```

then visit `http://localhost:8420/index.html`.

Photo-based age estimation additionally needs `age-service/` running (`cd age-service && pip install -r requirements.txt && python app.py`, serves on port 5001) - optional; the questionnaire degrades gracefully to its other age signals if the service isn't running.
