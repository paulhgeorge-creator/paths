/* Senior-dog stage content. Exemplar breed: Great Dane (giant-breed early
   senior onset, osteosarcoma). UMD-style export, matching frailty-model.js.

   Net-new cognition module (cherry-pick #3, ceo-plans doc): replaces the
   old p2_cognition/p2_cognition_detail pair with a deeper, paraphrased
   module inspired by CADES (Madari et al. 2015) and CCDR (Salvin et al.
   2011) domain structure - NOT a verbatim reproduction of either published
   instrument (licensing/reproduction-rights unconfirmed, see plan doc), and
   deliberately NOT a full 13-17 item copy of either scale. Instead it adds
   only the two domains genuinely uncovered elsewhere in this app's question
   set: house-soiling (a validated, later-emerging CADES factor) and
   aimless/repetitive activity (a classic DISHA-style marker distinct from
   p1_activity's exercise-minutes or mob_gate's physical mobility check).
   Disorientation keeps the existing p2_cognition wording/refine mechanism;
   sleep-wake and social-interaction domains are deliberately NOT duplicated
   here since p2_sleep and p2_interaction already cover them at a general
   level - adding cognition-flavored twins would double-count the same
   underlying deficit in the FI denominator.
   FI integration: cog_* ids are plain SCALE3-scored items feeding the same
   categoryFI()/observedFI Round-2 aggregation p2_* items already use - not
   a second, parallel score. */
