/* Young-cat stage content. Exemplar breed: Persian (polycystic kidney
   disease / PKD). UMD-style export, matching frailty-model.js.

   Research finding this content is built around: PKD in Persians is real
   and well-documented (prevalence studies in the 25-37% range), but average
   symptomatic-onset age is ~7 years (middle-age, not young) and cysts
   aren't reliably ultrasound-detectable before ~10 months. So this stage
   deliberately does NOT add a kidney-symptom question - that would ask a
   young-cat owner about something that mostly hasn't happened yet. Instead
   the breed-risk note below frames PKD as a genetic-testing/screening-
   history topic, which IS relevant now (screening can happen young even
   though symptoms mostly can't). No new scored question was added here -
   this stays within the CEO-review-approved scope (only senior-dog
   cognition and senior-cat mobility got net-new scored modules).

   MECE note: p2_cognition/p2_cognition_detail excluded, same reasoning as
   young-dog.js - no developmental relevance to a young cat. */
