/* Middle-cat stage content. Exemplar breed: Maine Coon (hypertrophic
   cardiomyopathy / HCM). UMD-style export, matching frailty-model.js.

   Research finding this content is built around: the MYBPC3-A31P mutation
   is real and breed-associated (found only in Maine Coons in one large
   European sample, ~41.5% carrier prevalence there), and 100% of
   homozygous carriers developed HCM within 5 years in a cohort study -
   genuinely a middle-age-bounded condition, supporting this stage placement.
   BUT most carriers are asymptomatic (only ~7% of carriers showed clinical
   signs in one cohort) - a pure symptom-question survey has a real
   detection ceiling here. Cherry-pick #6 (ceo-plans doc): the breed-risk
   note below says so plainly instead of implying symptom-watching alone is
   sufficient.

   No breed-conditional module here (unlike the dog files) - Maine Coon
   isn't in any existing name-tag list, so these HCM items live directly in
   the base question set instead, since Maine Coon is this whole cell's
   assumed default framing regardless of what breed was actually typed in. */
