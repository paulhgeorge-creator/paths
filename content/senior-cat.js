/* Senior-cat stage content. No breed exemplar - research found the working
   pick (Siamese) unsupported: elevated hyperthyroidism risk ties to
   long-haired non-purebred cats, not Siamese specifically, and no other
   breed held up under research for this cell (see
   ceo-plans/2026-07-16-life-stage-breed-surveys.md). Generic senior-cat
   framing instead, anchored on real population-level findings: CKD
   prevalence rises from 1.2% generally to 3.6% at 9y+, hyperthyroidism is
   the most common feline endocrine disease at this stage, and the two
   commonly co-occur (~5.7x odds).

   Net-new mobility module (cherry-pick #2, ceo-plans doc): replaces the
   single mob_gate item with the Enomoto/Lascelles/Gruen (2020) feline DJD
   checklist domains (run / jump up / jump down / stairs up / stairs down /
   chase), paraphrased rather than reproduced verbatim (licensing/
   reproduction-rights unconfirmed for the original published instrument).
   `mob_gate` becomes a DERIVED value (max of the 6 djd_* items below), never
   a directly-answered question in this stage's set, so index.html's 3
   existing `dependsOn:{id:"mob_gate",...}` consumers (p1_exhaustion,
   p3_exercise_tolerance, p3_muscle) and the joint-support food-tag read
   (index.html:1680) keep working unchanged once the loader computes that
   derived value - this file only supplies the 6 raw items, the loader is
   responsible for the roll-up. */
