/* Young-dog stage content. Exemplar breed: French Bulldog (BOAS).
   UMD-style export, matching frailty-model.js - works as
   <script src="content/young-dog.js"> and via require() from Node tests.

   `questions` entries are one of three things: a plain string (an existing
   PART1-4 question id, unchanged text - the loader resolves it against those
   arrays), an override object `{id, text}` (same id, so identical
   opts/dependsOn/scoring - "the same calculations" - just reworded for this
   stage/breed), or a full net-new question object (none needed for this
   stage). Overrides below reword breathing/skin/weight questions toward
   BOAS/brachycephalic-relevant framing and soften mob_gate away from
   aging-decline language that doesn't fit a young dog.

   MECE note: p2_cognition/p2_cognition_detail are deliberately excluded -
   canine cognitive dysfunction is an age-related syndrome (Salvin et al.
   2011; Madari et al. 2015) with no developmental relevance to young dogs,
   so asking about it here would be the exact "don't ask a puppy owner about
   senior stuff" problem this whole project pass exists to fix. */
